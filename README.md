Tracking my DSA journey for coding interviews

# ⚔️ Sai Kumar's DSA Battle Log

Just a guy trying to survive tech interviews one AC at a time.

This repo is my space to practice, mess up, figure things out, and (hopefully) get good at data structures and algorithms. Mostly solving LeetCode stuff in Java. Occasionally Python if Java says no.

## 🧩 What's in here?

- `arrays/` – sliding, prefixing, brute-forcing life
- `linked_lists/` – pointer hell
- `trees/` – recursive brain tangles
- `graphs/` – BFS, DFS, and existential questions
- `dp/` – disappointment and perseverance
- `backtracking/` – sudoku, subsets, and sanity checks

## 🎯 Side Quests

- [ ] Stop skipping DP
- [ ] 1 mock/week (Pramp / with a friend)
- [ ] Clean up messy code before pushing
- [ ] Comment key lines like a nice human

## 🧠 Mantras

- Dry run everything  
- If you brute force, *say it with confidence*  
- Better clean code than clever chaos  
- Think loud, code calm

Let’s go. LeetCode won’t solve itself. 💪
